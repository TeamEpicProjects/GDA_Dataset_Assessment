# GDA_Dataset_Assessment
Hello,

Welcome to the Round 2 of the Assessment for the Data Analyst role!

Please follow the instructions listed below to complete the assessment.

1. In this round, you are expected to analyse sample datasets and answer a few given questions. (Part 1)
2. Please find the datasets in the Datasets folder in the same repository or click [here](https://github.com/TeamEpicProjects/GDA_Dataset_Assessment/tree/main/Datasets).
3. Along with the dataset analysis, you will also find two separate questions for you to answer (Part 2). That will help us to understand your candidature better.

## Part 1: Dataset Based Questions:

In this stage, you are going to combine the Online Retail II data from 2009–2010 (online\_retail\_II.csv) with that of 2010–2011(online\_retail\_II2.csv), clean it, prepare it, and analyse it to come up with solutions to the following questions.

- Find out which customers placed the most and fewest orders.
- Find out which country has the customers who spent the most money on one item.
- Find out which month had the most orders.
- Find out which day of the month had the most orders.
- Find out which day of the week had the most orders.
- Find out which country has the customers who spent the most money on a product.
- Find out which country has the customers who placed the greatest number of orders.
- Find out which country had the customers who spent the greatest amount of money on orders.

## Part 2: General Questions:(to be added)

- Q2

Please make sure to add the complete, required code and relevant answers for the Dataset Assessment (Part 1) and General Questions (Part 2) in a Jupyter notebook and send the notebook file to support@teamepic.io.

Please use proper nomenclature for the Jupyter Notebook, for example, DA\_Round2\_JohnDoe or anything which will help us to identify your submissions easily.
